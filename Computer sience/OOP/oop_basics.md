OOP - Object Orienteiting Programming: fundamental programming poradigm. Relies on the concept that the programm is a set of objects that work whit each other.

Came to solve problem of spageti code. In oop we combuine grups of releyted varibls and functions  in unit, object wher varibels is  propertys, functions - metheds it's calls encapsulation. 

Abstructions - we can hide some not much important parametrs and methode from outside
it give us simpler interface and reduce the impact of change. 

Inhrtitance - mecanism that allow us to eluminate redunded code. We can create classes and objects, that will be simular, but litle bit different - have aditional atribution and methods

Polymorphism - same methods of diferent objects can do same tasks diferently.
