SOLID - its help to create a system, wich will be easy mantayn and expande in long periud of time.

S- Single responsibility principle
 For each class shuld be only one perpes.
O- open-closed principle
programm entetys shuld be open for
L- Liskov substitution princople
Finctions that use basic type have to have aportunity to use sub-type functions whitout knowing that.
I- interface segregation principle
many interfaces specificli for clients better then one for every thing
D- dependency inversion principle


Single - Responsibility - Principle 
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

Open-Closed Principle 
Objects or entites should be open for extendable but closed for modification. 
That means that a class should be extendable without  modifying the class itself.

liskov Substitution Priciple
Let q(x) be a property about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

Interface Segregation Principle 
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it boesn't use, or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods  they do not use.

Dependency Inversion Principle 
Entites must depend on abstractionsm not on conceretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstructions.
