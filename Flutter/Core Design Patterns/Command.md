Command design pattern (Action or Transaction) - one of the behavioural design pattern which intention is : 
Encapsilate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue of log requests, and support undoable operations. 
Comand objects serve as links between various UI and business logic objects. In this case, the command object could be bound to the UI element at runtime by the Clirn and thet particular UI component, coled Sender, invokes the request. The Sender triggers the assigned Command instead of sending the requst  directly to the Receiver - a simple or complex object which contains the actual logic for the reqrst to be fulfilled. A specific COmmand passes the call to ther recriver which dose  the acual work. As a result, commands become a convenient middle layer that reduces coupling between the UI and business logic layers.
