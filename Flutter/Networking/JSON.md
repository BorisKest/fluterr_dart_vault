JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA - 262 3rd Edition. Its a lenguage to transfer the data.


JSON built on two structures: 

A collection of name / value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, sturctm dictionaty, has table, keyed listm or associative arreay. An ordered list of values, In most languages, this realized as an array vector, list, of sequrnve.

These are univertsal data structures. Virtually all modern programming languages support them in one from or anothe. It makes sense that a data format that is interchangeable with programming languages also be based on these structures. 

In JSON, they take on these forms: 

An object is an unordered set of name/value pairs. An object begins with { left brace and ends with } right brace. Each name is followed by: colon and the name/value paitrs are separated by , comma. ![[Pasted image 20220731145943.png]]
