In flutter we have: 

intState - first life cycle method that is called,called before the build method.
We can do initialization in it
DidChangeDependencies - second livecycle method that is called. 
DidUpdateWidget - called whenever the widget configuration changes.
Diactivate - called when object is removed from the tree.
Dispose - when replacing this widget with another, for exemple using Navugator.pushRaplacement.
